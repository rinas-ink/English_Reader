# Frank Reader
An application that makes reading in English easier for Russian-speaking people.

Created during the spring semester of the first year of the Applied Mathematics and Informatics program at the Higher School of Economics of St. Petersburg.

## Dependencies for Ubuntu 20.04:
- Qt5 (`qt5-default`)
- `mysql-server`
- `libmysqlcppconn-dev`
- `nlohmann-json-dev`
- `libcrypto++-dev`
- `libssl-dev`
- `libcurl-dev`

Also it is nesessary to create files `config.json` with your own information. You can find examples of these files in `client` and `server` directories.
